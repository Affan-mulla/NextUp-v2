# 🚀 Nextup

**Nextup** is a collaborative platform for **makers, startups, and users** — where ideas meet execution.  
It helps **founders** launch and grow their products, while **users** can discover, follow, and contribute to the startups they love.

> Built for both — the **builder** and the **believer**.

---

## 🌐 Overview

Today, most launch platforms focus only on visibility — **Nextup** focuses on **community and feedback**.  
It’s a space where:
- 🚀 **Startups** can showcase products, manage feedback, and engage with their users.  
- 💬 **Users** can follow launches, share insights, and grow their reputation.  
- 🏆 **Both** benefit from real-time feedback loops, transparent growth, and recognition through leaderboards and launches.

Nextup bridges the gap between **launching** and **listening** — empowering products to grow *with* their community, not just in front of it.
